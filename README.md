# simple-twitter-clone-api
In this project i use nodejs and express framework with typescript programming language and use prisma.
In this api the authentication is passwordless. It performs with user's email and confirmation of one-time password by user.
# use "npm install and npm install -D for install the dependencies" and use "npm run dev" for run the server.

Thanks guys :)
